terrain:
- skirts for DEM-based terrain to hide cracks between tiles
- improved clamping of objects to terrain to avoid artefacts
- cull terrain tiles on horizon that are far

frustum culling:
- fix bounding box of point entities so that it works correctly
- re-enable frustum culling for chunked entities - bug sometimes culls incorrectly
- disable qt3d frustum culling for chunked entities (already explicitly done in qgis3d)

chunks:
- load points / lines / polygons with chunked entity if requested (for bigger data)
- loading queue using multiple threads

renderers:
- points as billboards
- polygons draped on terrain using shadow volumes
- lines 
- point clouds (as points / splats)
- 3D tiles

camera control:
- setup near/far plane to best utilize depth buffer (and distant stuff does not get culled)
- when zooming, zoom centered on mouse position rather than on center of the map
- detect collisions with terrain and do not let user go under terrain (if desired)
- animated transitions (zoom, move with keys)

appearance:
- use layer's single/categorized/graduated/rule-based renderers
- transparency
- shadows

QGIS integration:
- new library in src/3d
- test app in tests/src/3d
- GUI widgets for configuration (in src/app)
